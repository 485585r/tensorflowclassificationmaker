This project inludes a Langgraph agent that is able to:

* Read TensorFlow image classification documentation by using Beautiful Soup to scrape text content of the documentation

* Inspect images within your train dataset to identify correct image dimensions for Tensorflow Image Dataset parameters

* Create and run python code 

The agentic workflow can be seen below:
